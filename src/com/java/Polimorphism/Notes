Types of Polymorpism:

1) Compile Time Polymorphism/ Static polymorphism((Achived by)Method Overloading)
   method overloading -
     --same method name
     --but types assignment, return type ,ordering can be different
     
     Example - 
     Multiple constructure
     
     Numbers.java
     
2) Runtime / Dynamic Ploymorphism( achieved by method overriding)

    return type method name and arrgument everting are same but mehtod body is diff
