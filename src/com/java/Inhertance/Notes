super Keyword :

1) Avoiding Ambiguity:

When a subclass has a member with the same name as a member in the parent class, using super helps to distinguish between the two.

2) Accessing Parent Class Members:

super is used to access members (fields, methods, or nested classes) of the immediate parent class.
It is often used when a subclass has overridden a method or field and wants to refer to the parent class's version.

3) Calling Parent Class Constructors:

super() is used to call the constructor of the immediate parent class. It should be the first statement in the subclass constructor.
