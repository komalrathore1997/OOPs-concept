Types of inheritance:

1) Singal Inheritance -> one class extends another class
    
     Box--> BoxWeight
     
     Example: SingleInheritance.class
     
2) Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces)  -->

   * Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes (i.e., a class cannot extend more than one class).
    However, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
   * An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
     
   Example :
   
   interface Interface1 {
    // interface members
   }

	interface Interface2 {
	    // interface members
	}

	class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
	    // class members
	}
	    
2) Multi-level Inheritance ->
