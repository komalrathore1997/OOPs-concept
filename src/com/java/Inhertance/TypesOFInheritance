Types of inheritance:

1) Singal Inheritance -> one class extends another class
    
     Box--> BoxWeight
     
     Example: SingleInheritance.class
     
2) Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces)  -->

   * Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes (i.e., a class cannot extend more than one class).
    However, it supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
   * An interface in Java is a collection of abstract methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
     
   Example :
   
   interface Interface1 {
    // interface members
   }

	interface Interface2 {
	    // interface members
	}

	class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
	    // class members
	}
	    
3) Multi-level Inheritance ->  In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit from another class, and then another class can inherit from the derived class.

     A-> B-> C
     
     example: MultiLevelInheritance.class
     
4) Hierarchical Inheritance --> if a number of classes are derived from a single base class,it is called hierarchical inheritance

             student (super class)
             
      Science  commerce  Arts  (sub classes)
      
      
   Example :
   
   class Animal {
    // base class members
	}
	
	class Cat extends Animal {
	    // cat class members
	}
	
	class Dog extends Animal {
	    // dog class members
	}
      
5) Hybrid Inheritance --> 
   combination of single and multiple Interitance (java does not support hybrid inheritance)
